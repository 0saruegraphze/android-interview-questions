## How to Create a Bahis Analiz Program Excel?
  
Creating a bahis analiz program excel is not very difficult if you have some basic knowledge of Excel. Here are the steps you need to follow:
  
1. Create a new workbook and name it as "Bahis Analiz Program Excel".
2. In the first worksheet, enter the following headings in row 1: Date, Event, Bet Type, Stake, Odds, Result, Profit/Loss.
3. In the second worksheet, enter the following headings in row 1: Total Bets, Total Stake, Total Profit/Loss, ROI (%), Average Odds, Win Rate (%), Average Profit/Loss per Bet.
4. In the first worksheet, enter your betting data in the corresponding columns. For example, if you bet 100 TL on FenerbahÃ§e to win against Galatasaray at 2.00 odds on 23/04/2023 and FenerbahÃ§e won, you would enter: 23/04/2023, FenerbahÃ§e vs Galatasaray, 1X2, 100, 2.00, Win, 100.
5. In the second worksheet, enter the following formulas in the corresponding cells:
    - B2: =COUNTA(Sheet1!A:A)-1
    - B3: =SUM(Sheet1!D:D)
    - B4: =SUM(Sheet1!G:G)
    - B5: =B4/B3\*100
    - B6: =AVERAGE(Sheet1!E:E)
    - B7: =COUNTIF(Sheet1!F:F,"Win")/B2\*100
    - B8: =B4/B2
6. Format the cells as needed. For example, you can use currency format for B3 and B4, percentage format for B5 and B7, and decimal format for B6 and B8.
7. You can also create charts and graphs to visualize your data. For example, you can use a line chart to show your profit and loss over time, a pie chart to show your bet distribution by type, or a scatter plot to show your odds versus profit/loss.

By following these steps, you can create a simple but effective bahis analiz program excel that can help you analyze your betting data and improve your betting skills.
