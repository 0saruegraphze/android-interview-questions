Agarest: Generations of War Zero is a game that promises a lot but delivers little. It is a prequel to the original Agarest: Generations of War, a tactical role-playing game that spans multiple generations of heroes and heroines. The game features a complex battle system, a dating sim element, and a branching storyline that depends on your choices and actions.

However, the game suffers from many problems that make it hard to enjoy. The graphics are dated, the voice acting is mediocre, the loading times are long, the difficulty is uneven, and the gameplay is repetitive and tedious. The game also has many bugs and glitches that affect the performance and stability of the game.
 
Thankfully, the RELOADED Update aims to fix some of these issues and improve the overall quality of the game. The update includes several bug fixes, performance improvements, balance adjustments, and new features. Some of the notable changes are:
 
- The game now supports higher resolutions and widescreen modes.
- The game now has an option to skip animations and speed up battles.
- The game now has an auto-save feature and a quick save/load feature.
- The game now has a gallery mode where you can view CGs and scenes.
- The game now has a new difficulty mode called "Hardcore" where enemies are stronger and items are more scarce.
- The game now has a new character called Alice who joins your party in the second generation.

While the update does not fix all the flaws of the game, it does make it more playable and enjoyable. If you are a fan of the Agarest series or tactical RPGs in general, you might want to give this game another chance with the RELOADED Update. However, if you are looking for a polished and engaging game, you might want to look elsewhere.
  
The game's story is set before the events of the original Agarest: Generations of War. You play as Sieghart, a young soldier who is chosen by the gods to become the first hero of Agarest. Along the way, you will meet and romance various female characters who will become the mothers of your descendants. Each generation has its own protagonist, storyline, and gameplay features.
 
The game's battle system is a turn-based grid-based strategy game where you control up to six characters at a time. You can move your characters around the grid and perform various actions such as attacking, defending, using items, or casting spells. You can also combine your characters' skills to unleash powerful combo attacks. The game's battles are challenging and require careful planning and strategy.
 
The game's dating sim element is where you can interact with your female companions and increase your affinity with them. You can talk to them, give them gifts, or take them on dates. Depending on your choices and actions, you will affect their personality and appearance in the next generation. You will also unlock different endings and scenarios based on your relationships.
