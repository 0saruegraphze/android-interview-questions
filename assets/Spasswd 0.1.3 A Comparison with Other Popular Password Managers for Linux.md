4. Use subheadings and bullet points. Subheadings and bullet points help break up your article into manageable chunks and guide the reader through your main points. They also make your article more scannable and easier to read. Subheadings should summarize the main idea of each section and use keywords that relate to your topic. Bullet points should list important facts, tips, examples or steps that support your subheadings.
 
5. Provide credible sources and evidence. A good article is not just based on your opinion or personal experience. You need to back up your claims with reliable sources and evidence that support your arguments. This will make your article more trustworthy and authoritative. You can use different types of sources, such as books, journals, websites, reports, interviews or surveys. Make sure to cite your sources properly and link to them if possible.
 
6. Write a clear conclusion. A conclusion is the last chance you have to leave a lasting impression on your reader and summarize the main points of your article. A good conclusion should do three things: restate your thesis or main argument, highlight the key takeaways or implications of your article and end with a call to action or a question that encourages further discussion or action.
 
7. Proofread and edit your article. Before you publish or submit your article, you need to proofread and edit your article for any errors, inconsistencies or gaps in logic. You can use tools like Grammarly or Hemingway to check your spelling, grammar and readability. You can also ask someone else to read your article and give you feedback. A fresh pair of eyes can help you spot mistakes that you might have missed.
